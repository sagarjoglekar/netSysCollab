\section{Introduction}
Online social networks (OSNs) have seen a massive surge in usage over the past decade. The surge is going hand in hand with the explosion of smart phone industry. More and more social interactions are now driven by media contents like selfies, group selfies and videos because of the ubiquitous nature of cameras. A sharp change in cultural aspects of online social interactions are evident and have also been studied in detail in papers like \cite{Souza2015}. 
%Naturally, properties of real life interactions are now going to emerge in virtual social interactions. A study by Daniel Perez et.al \cite{7175072} observes that non-verbal communication has a strong effect on how a person is perceived at times of real world situations like interviews. These real world behaviours can also be extended to the virtual social world. 
With the rise of social media networks like Vine and Instagram, human to human non-verbal interactions have another dimension to manifest. One of the predominant modality of self expression arose from this boom in social media, and that was the Selfie. The \cite{Souza2015} paper explores several of the properties of selfie amongst Instagram users, where they explore correlation of facial orientation, poses and smiles with parameters like country of origin of the selfie user, post frequency, likes received , number of faces in the pictures, gender and smile scores. Such studies give us interesting insights about the sharp rising OSN phenomena of selfies. The study also states that more than 50 percent of photos shared on Instagram, fall under the category if selfies.

A major change in these behaviours was seen when the social network called Vine was launched in 2012. Vine adds another dimension to the act of self expression, where the users can record a 7 second long video and post it online and get engagement from peers. This service got so popular that the larger services like Instagram and Twitter also added the feature of short videos to their services.
