\section{Discussion and future work}
After this initial investigation, we can confidently say that like Instagram \cite{Bakhshi:2014:FEU:2611105.2557403}, vine and other video expression mediums would have a high engagement score for videos with faces. Further with the high correlation between face adjective noun pairs and repost or likes implies that there are certain kinds of sentiments in videos with faces, which invite much larger engagement from other users.
As a future roadmap for this study, we would like to explore deeper into the sentiment and affective aspects of video selfies. The larger big picture ambition for this study is to delve into evoked sentiments using latent sentiments that touch upon in this paper. With the advancement of Deep learning tools, such work is on the horizon.
