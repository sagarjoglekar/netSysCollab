\section{Abstract}
This paper tries to explore the art of story telling in the realm of Online Social Networks (OSNs) and online social media. In the due course of the work done for the paper, we crawled a popular social media network called Vine for almost 2 months and collected over 12000 unique vine videos and their post meta data. We try to take an approach based on perceptual sentiment in social media and hypothesize existence of story lines in perceptual sentiments. We use deep learning tools to detect sentiment values of videos frames using the popular framework of Sentibank. The paper hypothesizes and shows to a reasonable extent, that perceptual sentiments do follow popular screenwriting theories. The sentiment transitions across these short but high impact videos, do follow certain trends which could be explained from popular screenplay writing theories. The paper also evaluates correlations of individual perceptual sentiments of videos with popularity metrics of the videos.
