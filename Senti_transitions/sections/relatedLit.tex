\section{ Dataset }
We crawled vine for over a month and did a snowball sampling to collect over 12000 videos. The popularity distribution follows as expected a zipf distribution. The videos were then passed through a sampling process, where we sampled one frame from each second of the video lenght. The sampling was chosen purely hurestically. The main aim behind the sampling was to measure the perceptual sentiment as the video progresses. The figure \ref{fig:CDF_posts} shows the distribution of the crawled vine posts
