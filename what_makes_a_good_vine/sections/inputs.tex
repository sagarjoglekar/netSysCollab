To validate and understand the significance of the primacy property, it was important to understand relation of engegement of users with the primal states of a micro video. Following the methodology of training iterative and progressively selective classifier, we set up an experiement where the classifier would be trained on features extracted only from the intial 2 seconds of vine mico video instead of the entire video. We chose aesthetic and sentiment features extracted from frames sampled in the first two seconds and repeated the classfier training with the same set of hyper parameters for the classifier. It can be observed from the fig ~\ref{fig:Classifier_performance}, that the classifier trained of the primal sections of the videos, resulted in identical or in some cases better results, when compared to the classifer trained on the whole video. This validates the hypotheis that producers are deliberately or inadvertantly creating contents that engage users in the first one third of the micro video.
